### Q1: Explain C compilation process in detail ###

The C compilation process converts source code into object code or machine code. 
The compilation process can be divided into four steps:

**1.	Preprocessor**
 *	Macros expansion
 *	File inclusion
 *	Conditional Compilation
 *	replaces the macros with their respective values
 *	includes the necessary header files.

**2.	Compiler**
*	takes the preprocessed code and converts it into assembly code
*	converts the intermediate file (.i) into an Assembly file (.s)
*	analyzes the code to detect syntax errors, type errors, and other issues
*	Contains: 
    *	Tokenizer (Removes comments and spaces)
    *	Syntax analyzer (has all C language rules)
    *	Parser (.c -> .asm)
    *	Optimizer (least exec time and least mem consumption)
*	If there are any errors, the compilation process stops, and the errors are reported to the developer

**3.	Assembler**
*	Takes in the assembly code generated in the previous step and converts it into machine code
*	generates an object file that can be linked with other object files to create a complete program

**4.	Linker**
*	takes the machine code generated by the assembler and links it with other necessary libraries to create an executable file
*	resolves external references
*	provides the necessary information for the OS to load the executable file into memory

The final output of the compilation process is an executable file that can be run on the target system. This file contains the machine instructions generated by the assembler and the necessary libraries linked by the linker.

### Q2: What is the difference between static, extern, volatile and register keywords? ###

**Static** is used to create a variable that is allocated for the entire lifetime of the program. A static variable can be declared inside a function or outside it, and it retains its value between function calls. If declared inside a function, the variable has local scope, which means it can only be accessed within that function. If declared outside a function, the variable has global scope, which means it can be accessed from any function in the program.

**Extern** is used to declare a variable or function that is defined in another source file or module. When a variable or function is declared as extern, the compiler knows that it is not defined in the current file and looks for its definition in other source files or modules.

**Volatile** is used to tell the compiler that a variable's value may be changed several times by some external entity or hardware, and that the compiler should not optimize away reads or writes to that variable. It tells the compiler that the variable's value can change unexpectedly, and that the value should be re-read or re-written every time it is accessed. An optimized variable can be invisible to other threads and never reach the main memory.

**Register** is used to tell the compiler to store the variable in a register instead of memory. This can result in faster access to the variable because registers are faster than memory. However, the use of “register” is only a suggestion to the compiler, and it may choose to ignore the request if it cannot be satisfied due to the limited number of registers available.

### Q3: How can we return multiple values from a function in C? ###
In C or C++, we cannot return multiple values from a function directly. But, we can use these tricks to return more than one value from a function:

* call by reference: A function can modify the values of multiple variables by passing their memory addresses as pointers to the function.
* Struct: A function can return a structure that contains multiple values.
