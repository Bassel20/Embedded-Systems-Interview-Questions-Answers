# Embedded-Systems-Interview-Questions-Answers
Helping you prepare for your upcoming embedded interviews
The main goal of this initiative is to revise the fundamentals of embedded systems, be prepared for your next interview, and get familiar with the expected questions in an embedded systems interview. For better access, the questions and answers are gathered here in this GitHub repository. They will be updated with new questions.

The questions are divided into the following categories:

* [C Programming](*file link*)
* [Embedded Concepts](*file link*)
* [Communication Protocols](*file link*)
* [Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS)](*file link*)
* [Problem Solving (Coding Questions)](*file link*)
* [Resume Based Questions](*file link*)
