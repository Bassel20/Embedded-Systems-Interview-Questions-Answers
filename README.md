# Embedded-Systems-Interview-Questions-Answers
Helping you prepare for your upcoming embedded interviews

The main goal of this initiative is to revise the fundamentals of embedded systems, be prepared for your next interview, and get familiar with the expected questions in an embedded systems interview. For better access, the questions and answers are gathered here in this GitHub repository. They will be continuously updated with new questions periodically.

The questions are divided into the following categories:

* [C Programming](https://github.com/Bassel20/Embedded-Systems-Interview-Questions-Answers/blob/main/C%20Programming%20Questions.md)
* [Embedded Concepts](https://github.com/Bassel20/Embedded-Systems-Interview-Questions-Answers/blob/main/Embedded%20Concepts%20Questions.md)
* [Communication Protocols](https://github.com/Bassel20/Embedded-Systems-Interview-Questions-Answers/blob/main/Communication%20Protocols%20Questions.md)
* [Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS)](https://github.com/Bassel20/Embedded-Systems-Interview-Questions-Answers/blob/main/Real%20Time%20Operating%20Systems%20(RTOS)%20Questions.md)
* [Coding Questions](https://github.com/Bassel20/Embedded-Systems-Interview-Questions-Answers/blob/main/Coding%20Questions.md)
* [Resume Based Questions](https://github.com/Bassel20/Embedded-Systems-Interview-Questions-Answers/blob/main/Resume%20Based%20Questions.md)
